    "#### Task 1. Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.\n",

    "Many mathermatical operations have an opposite operaton. Finding the square root of a number is the inverse of squaring a number. The square of a number is that number times itself, while the square root of a number x is the number that gives x when multiplied by itself, i.e. the square root of 100 is 10, becase 10 * 10 = 100 [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to calculate the square root of a number. Let's take a look at a simple way of calculating a square root of a number without the use of a calculator. Let's look at finding the square root of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate - get a starting point by finding two perfect square roots that your number is between. As we're looking to find the square root of 2, our two perfect square roots are 1 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Divide - next we need to divide our number by one of those square roots: 2 / 1 = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Average - take the average of the result of step 2 (2) and the root (1): 2 + 1 = 3 / 2 = 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3: 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 + 1.5 = 2.83 / 2 = 1.41\n",
    "\n",
    "So based on the above, the square root of  = 1.41, which is correct to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a more accurate result, we can calculate the square root of a number by using Newton's method. Newton's method is a root-finding algorithm whcih produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the square root $z$ of a number $x$, we can iterate using the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_{next} = z - \\frac{z^2 - x}{2z} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers typically compute the square root of x using a loop. Starting with some guess $z$, we adjust $z$ based on how close $z^2$ is to $x$, producing a better guess. Repeating this adjustment makes the guess better and better until we reach an answer that is as close to the actual square root as can be [3].\n",
